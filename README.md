By Wanying

## **Introduction**

This project was done as part of the General Assembly Data Analyst Bootcamp. 💻

Rainbow Riley is an AI chatbot that can receive inputs on what grocery items have been chosen and then return what is missing in terms of the 5-colour diet. Thereafter, it can also recommend a suitable recipe for these said ingredients. 

## **Modelling**

The chosen model for this chatbot is gpt-4-1106 as it had a good relevancy score and had the best output in terms of providing both missing colour ingredients and suggesting the recipe to try for that combination of fruits/vegetables.
