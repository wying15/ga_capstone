Grapefruit,,,,,Peaches,,,,,Mushrooms,,,,,Brussels Sprouts,,,,,Purple Asparagus,,,,,"Total time: 40 mins, Serves 2-3

Charred brussels sprouts with grapefruit and yuba
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

Instructions:
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

For the brussels sprouts, preheat the oven to 445°F/230°C. Meanwhile, in an ovenproof pan, preferably made of cast-iron, toss together 2 tbsp oil, 350g brussels sprouts (bases trimmed, halved) and 1/2 tsp salt.

Place the brussels sprouts cut side down in the pan and set the pan on high heat for a few minutes, or until the cut sides of the brussels sprouts turn light golden. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the brussels sprouts are tender and charred.

For the tofu sticks, on high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, steam 40g dried tofu sticks.

Once the tofu sticks have softened up nicely, remove them from the steamer and snip them into 2-inch/5cm lengths with a pair of scissors.

To a sauce pan set on high heat, add oil (as needed for deep-frying). When the oil heats up to 300°F/150°C, add the tofu sticks. Cook for about a minute, turning occasionally until they puff and blister. They should hardly develop any colour. If the oil is too hot, the tofu sticks will brown too quickly and blisters will not form. Remove the fried tofu from the pan and transfer them to a paper towel-lined dish to drain.

For the dressing, in a small bowl, mix together 3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise, 3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce, 3/4 tsp sugar, 45g Japanese pickled ginger (chopped) and 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil.

To serve, with a knife, remove the skin and pith of 1 large grapefruit. Peel and cut the grapefruit into segments, then cut each segment into thirds crosswise. Place the grapefruit in a serving bowl or platter and toss with the brussels sprouts and tofu sticks.

Drizzle the dressing over everything and scatter over a handful of nori strips.

Cabbage and glass noodles
Ingredients:
1 package mung bean vermicelli
(50g/1.75oz)
1 pound green cabbage (preferably Taiwanese cabbage; about 1/2 of a small to medium cabbage)
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (plus 1 teaspoon)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3-5 dried red chilis (break them open if you want more heat)
2 cloves garlic (chopped)
1 scallion (chopped)
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Instructions:
Soak the mung bean vermicelli noodles for about 10 minutes until soft. Cut the bundle in half to shorten the noodle lengths, and set them aside (still in the soaking water). Prep the cabbage by slicing it into 1/2-inch thick strips.
Beat the eggs along with the salt, sesame oil and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil, and the eggs quickly after. Scramble them for 20-30 seconds, until they’re just almost done (they can still be a bit runny). Take the eggs out of the wok and set aside.
Heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add the chili, garlic, and scallion. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to turn brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.
Pull the noodles out of the soaking water, and add them to the cabbage. Then add the cooked egg and the 1 remaining tablespoon of shaoxing wine. Stir-fry, then add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Stir everything together and continue to stir-fry for another 2 minutes or so, until the noodles are tender (add a splash of water if the noodles look dry). Plate and serve!

Cabbage and glass noodles
Ingredients:
1 package mung bean vermicelli
(50g/1.75oz)
1 pound green cabbage (preferably Taiwanese cabbage; about 1/2 of a small to medium cabbage)
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (plus 1 teaspoon)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

2 cloves garlic (chopped)
1 scallion (chopped)
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Instructions:
Soak the mung bean vermicelli noodles for about 10 minutes until soft. Cut the bundle in half to shorten the noodle lengths, and set them aside (still in the soaking water). Prep the cabbage by slicing it into 1/2-inch thick strips.
Beat the eggs along with the salt, sesame oil and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil, and the eggs quickly after. Scramble them for 20-30 seconds, until they’re just almost done (they can still be a bit runny). Take the eggs out of the wok and set aside.
Heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add the chili, garlic, and scallion. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to turn brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.
Pull the noodles out of the soaking water, and add them to the cabbage. Then add the cooked egg and the 1 remaining tablespoon of shaoxing wine. Stir-fry, then add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Stir everything together and continue to stir-fry for another 2 minutes or so, until the noodles are tender (add a splash of water if the noodles look dry). Plate and serve!

Grapefruit,,,,,Yellow Tomatoes,,,,,White Peaches,,,,,Japanese Green,,,,,Blackberries,,,,,"Total time: 40 mins, Serves 2-3

Charred brussels sprouts with grapefruit and yuba
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

Instructions:
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

For the brussels sprouts, preheat the oven to 445°F/230°C. Meanwhile, in an ovenproof pan, preferably made of cast-iron, toss together 2 tbsp oil, 350g brussels sprouts (bases trimmed, halved) and 1/2 tsp salt.

Place the brussels sprouts cut side down in the pan and set the pan on high heat for a few minutes, or until the cut sides of the brussels sprouts turn light golden. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the brussels sprouts are tender and charred.

For the tofu sticks, on high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, steam 40g dried tofu sticks.

Once the tofu sticks have softened up nicely, remove them from the steamer and snip them into 2-inch/5cm lengths with a pair of scissors.

To a sauce pan set on high heat, add oil (as needed for deep-frying). When the oil heats up to 300°F/150°C, add the tofu sticks. Cook for about a minute, turning occasionally until they puff and blister. They should hardly develop any colour. If the oil is too hot, the tofu sticks will brown too quickly and blisters will not form. Remove the fried tofu from the pan and transfer them to a paper towel-lined dish to drain.

For the dressing, in a small bowl, mix together 3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise, 3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce, 3/4 tsp sugar, 45g Japanese pickled ginger (chopped) and 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil.

To serve, with a knife, remove the skin and pith of 1 large grapefruit. Peel and cut the grapefruit into segments, then cut each segment into thirds crosswise. Place the grapefruit in a serving bowl or platter and toss with the brussels sprouts and tofu sticks.

Drizzle the dressing over everything and scatter over a handful of nori strips.

Red cabbage,,,,,Dates,,,,,Parsnips,,,,,Lettuce,,,,,Black grapes,,,,,"Total time: 25 mins, Serves 4

Cabbage and glass noodles
Ingredients:
1 package mung bean vermicelli
(50g/1.75oz)
1 pound green cabbage (preferably Taiwanese cabbage; about 1/2 of a small to medium cabbage)
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (plus 1 teaspoon)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3-5 dried red chilis (break them open if you want more heat)
2 cloves garlic (chopped)
1 scallion (chopped)
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Instructions:
Soak the mung bean vermicelli noodles for about 10 minutes until soft. Cut the bundle in half to shorten the noodle lengths, and set them aside (still in the soaking water). Prep the cabbage by slicing it into 1/2-inch thick strips.
Beat the eggs along with the salt, sesame oil and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil, and the eggs quickly after. Scramble them for 20-30 seconds, until they’re just almost done (they can still be a bit runny). Take the eggs out of the wok and set aside.
Heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add the chili, garlic, and scallion. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to turn brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.
Pull the noodles out of the soaking water, and add them to the cabbage. Then add the cooked egg and the 1 remaining tablespoon of shaoxing wine. Stir-fry, then add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Stir everything together and continue to stir-fry for another 2 minutes or so, until the noodles are tender (add a splash of water if the noodles look dry). Plate and serve!
