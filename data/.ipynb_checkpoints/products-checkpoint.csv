Freekeh salad with nectarine and halloumi
Ingredients:
150g freekeh, rinsed in several changes of water
1 bunch parsley
½ bunch mint, leaves picked
4 spring onions
3 nectarines, stoned
½ cucumber
150g baby tomatoes, quartered
1 big handful walnuts
3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Juice of 2 lemons
1 pinch ground cumin
Salt and black pepper
2 little gem lettuce, leaves separated
250g halloumi, drained, cut into 5mm slices

Instructions:
Bring a pan of water to a boil and cook the freekeh for 30 minutes, until tender. Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients.

Finely chop the parsley, mint and spring onions and transfer to a large bowl. Cut the nectarines into wedges, then cut the cucumber in half lengthways and, using a teaspoon, scoop out and discard the seeds. Roughly dice into 1-2cm pieces. Roughly chop the walnuts to match and add them all to the bowl.

Once the freekeh is cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to cool. Add to the salad bowl along with two tablespoons of oil, the lemon juice, cumin and plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss well and transfer to a large platter (or individual plates, if you prefer). Scatter the little gem leaves around the edge.

To cook the halloumi, warm up a medium-sized frying pan and, when hot, add the remaining oil. Pat each slice of halloumi dry with kitchen paper and add to the hot oil, turning over when golden – about a minute. When cooked, transfer to the top of the salad and serve at once.

Grapefruit,Peaches,Mushrooms,Brussels Sprouts,Raisins,"Total time: 40 mins, Serves 2-3

Charred brussels sprouts with grapefruit and yuba
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

Instructions:
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

For the brussels sprouts, preheat the oven to 445Â°F/230Â°C. Meanwhile, in an ovenproof pan, preferably made of cast-iron, toss together 2 tbsp oil, 350g brussels sprouts (bases trimmed, halved) and 1/2 tsp salt.

Place the brussels sprouts cut side down in the pan and set the pan on high heat for a few minutes, or until the cut sides of the brussels sprouts turn light golden. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the brussels sprouts are tender and charred.

For the tofu sticks, on high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, steam 40g dried tofu sticks.

Once the tofu sticks have softened up nicely, remove them from the steamer and snip them into 2-inch/5cm lengths with a pair of scissors.

To a sauce pan set on high heat, add oil (as needed for deep-frying). When the oil heats up to 300Â°F/150Â°C, add the tofu sticks. Cook for about a minute, turning occasionally until they puff and blister. They should hardly develop any colour. If the oil is too hot, the tofu sticks will brown too quickly and blisters will not form. Remove the fried tofu from the pan and transfer them to a paper towel-lined dish to drain.

For the dressing, in a small bowl, mix together 3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise, 3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce, 3/4 tsp sugar, 45g Japanese pickled ginger (chopped) and 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil.

To serve, with a knife, remove the skin and pith of 1 large grapefruit. Peel and cut the grapefruit into segments, then cut each segment into thirds crosswise. Place the grapefruit in a serving bowl or platter and toss with the brussels sprouts and tofu sticks.

Drizzle the dressing over everything and scatter over a handful of nori strips.

1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (plus 1 teaspoon)

2 cloves garlic (chopped)
1 scallion (chopped)
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add the chili, garlic, and scallion. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to turn brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.
Pull the noodles out of the soaking water, and add them to the cabbage. Then add the cooked egg and the 1 remaining tablespoon of shaoxing wine. Stir-fry, then add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Stir everything together and continue to stir-fry for another 2 minutes or so, until the noodles are tender (add a splash of water if the noodles look dry). Plate and serve!

Rinse the lentils a few times and soak them in water for 6-12 hours. Drain and cook in an instant pot or pressure cooker with 4 cups of water on high pressure for 30 minutes. If you don’t have an instant pot, cook the lentils with 4-6 cups of water in a pot with a lid on medium low heat for 4-6 hours like you would beans.

Once the lentils have softened, prepare your masala. Heat the oil on medium high heat until it shimmers. Add the onions and cook for 3-5 minutes until softened. Add the ginger and cook for just a minute until fragrant.

Add the spices and cook for a minute until aromatic. Add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes sautéing often. Transfer the onion, spice, tomato mixture to the cooked lentils and stir well. At this point, you can add more water to the lentils if you’d like a soupier texture. Add salt to taste and simmer the lentils with the spices for 10 minutes. Stir in the butter.

Whisk the yogurt with the salt, cumin, chili and a splash of water until smooth. Drizzle the spiced yogurt onto the lentils, top with fresh cilantro and enjoy.

Wild blueberry blood orange ginger smoothie
Ingredients
2 (15-ounce/425g) cans black beans, undrained*
Sofrito
1 ½ tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 small red or yellow onion, diced
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 jalapeño or serrano pepper, diced**
½ teaspoon ground cumin
1 ½ teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
½ teaspoon chipotle chile flakes or red pepper flakes***
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
Freshly cracked black pepper
1 pound (454g) fresh tomatoes or 1 (14-ounce/400g) can of diced tomatoes
Finishing
A glug of extra virgin olive oil****
A squeeze or two of lime juice
1 cup (16g) fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped


Instructions
Don’t drain the beans!

Prep the fresh tomatoes, if using. Wash, and then add to a food processor and pulse until pureed. Or grate the tomatoes using the wide holes of a box grater.

Make the sofrito. Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat with 1 ½ tablespoons of oil. Once hot, add the onion with a pinch of salt and cook until the onion has softened and is golden but not browned, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, jalapeño, cumin, oregano, and chipotle flakes (if using) and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add the diced tomatoes. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a rapid simmer and cook until the tomatoes break down and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with the kosher salt and several cracks of black pepper.

Pour the black beans with their liquid into the sofrito. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 15 minutes until thickened and saucy. If it gets too thick, add a splash of vegetable broth if you have it, or water.

Stir in a glug of extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of lime juice, and cilantro. Taste, and add salt/pepper or more lime juice to taste.

Charred brussels sprouts with grapefruit and yuba
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

Instructions:
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

For the brussels sprouts, preheat the oven to 445Â°F/230Â°C. Meanwhile, in an ovenproof pan, preferably made of cast-iron, toss together 2 tbsp oil, 350g brussels sprouts (bases trimmed, halved) and 1/2 tsp salt.

Place the brussels sprouts cut side down in the pan and set the pan on high heat for a few minutes, or until the cut sides of the brussels sprouts turn light golden. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the brussels sprouts are tender and charred.

For the tofu sticks, on high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, steam 40g dried tofu sticks.

Once the tofu sticks have softened up nicely, remove them from the steamer and snip them into 2-inch/5cm lengths with a pair of scissors.

To a sauce pan set on high heat, add oil (as needed for deep-frying). When the oil heats up to 300Â°F/150Â°C, add the tofu sticks. Cook for about a minute, turning occasionally until they puff and blister. They should hardly develop any colour. If the oil is too hot, the tofu sticks will brown too quickly and blisters will not form. Remove the fried tofu from the pan and transfer them to a paper towel-lined dish to drain.

For the dressing, in a small bowl, mix together 3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise, 3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce, 3/4 tsp sugar, 45g Japanese pickled ginger (chopped) and 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil.

To serve, with a knife, remove the skin and pith of 1 large grapefruit. Peel and cut the grapefruit into segments, then cut each segment into thirds crosswise. Place the grapefruit in a serving bowl or platter and toss with the brussels sprouts and tofu sticks.

Drizzle the dressing over everything and scatter over a handful of nori strips.

Cabbage and glass noodles
Ingredients:
1 package mung bean vermicelli
(50g/1.75oz)
1 pound green cabbage (preferably Taiwanese cabbage; about 1/2 of a small to medium cabbage)
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (plus 1 teaspoon)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3-5 dried red chilis (break them open if you want more heat)
2 cloves garlic (chopped)
1 scallion (chopped)
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Instructions:
Soak the mung bean vermicelli noodles for about 10 minutes until soft. Cut the bundle in half to shorten the noodle lengths, and set them aside (still in the soaking water). Prep the cabbage by slicing it into 1/2-inch thick strips.
Beat the eggs along with the salt, sesame oil and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil, and the eggs quickly after. Scramble them for 20-30 seconds, until theyâ€™re just almost done (they can still be a bit runny). Take the eggs out of the wok and set aside.
Heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add the chili, garlic, and scallion. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to turn brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.
Pull the noodles out of the soaking water, and add them to the cabbage. Then add the cooked egg and the 1 remaining tablespoon of shaoxing wine. Stir-fry, then add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Stir everything together and continue to stir-fry for another 2 minutes or so, until the noodles are tender (add a splash of water if the noodles look dry). Plate and serve!
