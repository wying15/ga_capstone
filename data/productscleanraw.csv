Freekeh salad with nectarine and halloumi
Ingredients:
150g freekeh, rinsed in several changes of water
1 bunch parsley
½ bunch mint, leaves picked
4 spring onions
3 nectarines, stoned
½ cucumber
150g baby tomatoes, quartered
1 big handful walnuts
3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Juice of 2 lemons
1 pinch ground cumin
Salt and black pepper
2 little gem lettuce, leaves separated
250g halloumi, drained, cut into 5mm slices

Instructions:
Bring a pan of water to a boil and cook the freekeh for 30 minutes, until tender. Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients.

Finely chop the parsley, mint and spring onions and transfer to a large bowl. Cut the nectarines into wedges, then cut the cucumber in half lengthways and, using a teaspoon, scoop out and discard the seeds. Roughly dice into 1-2cm pieces. Roughly chop the walnuts to match and add them all to the bowl.

Once the freekeh is cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to cool. Add to the salad bowl along with two tablespoons of oil, the lemon juice, cumin and plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss well and transfer to a large platter (or individual plates, if you prefer). Scatter the little gem leaves around the edge.

To cook the halloumi, warm up a medium-sized frying pan and, when hot, add the remaining oil. Pat each slice of halloumi dry with kitchen paper and add to the hot oil, turning over when golden – about a minute. When cooked, transfer to the top of the salad and serve at once.

Steamed yellow croaker with salted black olives
Ingredients:
2 yellow croakers (780 g)
1 tbsp white rice vinegar
2 tsp salt
12 salted black olives (180 g)
80 ml olive oil or cooking oil
3 garlic cloves, chopped
1 red finger chilli, sliced
1 stalk of spring onion (5 g), sliced
2 stalks of coriander (5 g)

Instructions:
Use a knife to scrape remaining scales off the yellow croakers.
Place the fish in a deep dish. Add white rice vinegar and 1 tsp of salt. Rub the mixture all over each fish. Rinse well.
Place the fish in a heat-proof dish and rub Â½ tsp of salt over the two pieces, sprinkling some into the fish cavity. Take care not to break any fish egg or milt in the cavity.
Cover the dish with cling wrap and place it in the fridge to chill if you are not cooking it right away.
Remove the fish from the fridge. Leave it on kitchen counter 45 minutes before steaming.
Rinse the salted black olives briefly. Place an olive on the cutting board. Using a kitchen knife, gently slice around the middle of the pit as you push the knife forward. Pull apart the two halves of the olive gently with your fingers. It should come apart easily and cleanly. Discard the pit. Repeat with remaining olives. Slice the olives laterally.
Heat 2 tbsps of oil (30 ml) in a frying pan. Add the chopped garlic and olives. Stir-fry for 90 secs. Set aside.
Drain off excess water at the bottom of the dish containing the yellow croakers.
Place the stir-fried olive and garlic mixture over the fish. Steam the fish for 8 mins.
Two minutes before the end of the steaming time, heat 50ml of olive oil over medium-low heat in a separate pan.
Once the fish is steamed, add the sliced chilli and spring onion over the fish.
Turn off the heat for the oil and pour the hot oil over the fish. Garnish with coriander and serve immediately.

Charred brussels sprouts with grapefruit and yuba
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

Instructions:
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

For the brussels sprouts, preheat the oven to 445Â°F/230Â°C. Meanwhile, in an ovenproof pan, preferably made of cast-iron, toss together 2 tbsp oil, 350g brussels sprouts (bases trimmed, halved) and 1/2 tsp salt.

Place the brussels sprouts cut side down in the pan and set the pan on high heat for a few minutes, or until the cut sides of the brussels sprouts turn light golden. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the brussels sprouts are tender and charred.

For the tofu sticks, on high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, steam 40g dried tofu sticks.

Once the tofu sticks have softened up nicely, remove them from the steamer and snip them into 2-inch/5cm lengths with a pair of scissors.

To a sauce pan set on high heat, add oil (as needed for deep-frying). When the oil heats up to 300Â°F/150Â°C, add the tofu sticks. Cook for about a minute, turning occasionally until they puff and blister. They should hardly develop any colour. If the oil is too hot, the tofu sticks will brown too quickly and blisters will not form. Remove the fried tofu from the pan and transfer them to a paper towel-lined dish to drain.

For the dressing, in a small bowl, mix together 3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise, 3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce, 3/4 tsp sugar, 45g Japanese pickled ginger (chopped) and 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil.

To serve, with a knife, remove the skin and pith of 1 large grapefruit. Peel and cut the grapefruit into segments, then cut each segment into thirds crosswise. Place the grapefruit in a serving bowl or platter and toss with the brussels sprouts and tofu sticks.

Drizzle the dressing over everything and scatter over a handful of nori strips.

Cabbage and glass noodles
Ingredients:
1 package mung bean vermicelli
(50g/1.75oz)
1 pound green cabbage (preferably Taiwanese cabbage; about 1/2 of a small to medium cabbage)
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (plus 1 teaspoon)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3-5 dried red chilis (break them open if you want more heat)
2 cloves garlic (chopped)
1 scallion (chopped)
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Instructions:
Soak the mung bean vermicelli noodles for about 10 minutes until soft. Cut the bundle in half to shorten the noodle lengths, and set them aside (still in the soaking water). Prep the cabbage by slicing it into 1/2-inch thick strips.
Beat the eggs along with the salt, sesame oil and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil, and the eggs quickly after. Scramble them for 20-30 seconds, until theyâ€™re just almost done (they can still be a bit runny). Take the eggs out of the wok and set aside.
Heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add the chili, garlic, and scallion. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to turn brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.
Pull the noodles out of the soaking water, and add them to the cabbage. Then add the cooked egg and the 1 remaining tablespoon of shaoxing wine. Stir-fry, then add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Stir everything together and continue to stir-fry for another 2 minutes or so, until the noodles are tender (add a splash of water if the noodles look dry). Plate and serve!

Dal Makhani (Indian Black Lentils)
Ingredients
2 cups urad dal (Indian black lentils) 
2 tablespoons avocado or neutral oil 
1 red onion, finely chopped 
2 heaped teaspoons minced ginger 
1.5 tablespoons Garam Masala 
½ teaspoon Red Chili Powder
1 cup chopped tomatoes in their juices
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons butter or vegan butter
1 tablespoon Greek or plant based yourt 
Pinch of salt 
Pinch of ground cumin
Pinch of red chili powder
1 teaspoon freshly chopped cilantro

Instructions
Rinse the lentils a few times and soak them in water for 6-12 hours. Drain and cook in an instant pot or pressure cooker with 4 cups of water on high pressure for 30 minutes. If you don’t have an instant pot, cook the lentils with 4-6 cups of water in a pot with a lid on medium low heat for 4-6 hours like you would beans.

Once the lentils have softened, prepare your masala. Heat the oil on medium high heat until it shimmers. Add the onions and cook for 3-5 minutes until softened. Add the ginger and cook for just a minute until fragrant.

Add the spices and cook for a minute until aromatic. Add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes sautéing often. Transfer the onion, spice, tomato mixture to the cooked lentils and stir well. At this point, you can add more water to the lentils if you’d like a soupier texture. Add salt to taste and simmer the lentils with the spices for 10 minutes. Stir in the butter.

Whisk the yogurt with the salt, cumin, chili and a splash of water until smooth. Drizzle the spiced yogurt onto the lentils, top with fresh cilantro and enjoy.

Simmered Daikon Radish Recipe
Ingredients:
1 lb. Daikon radish, see notes for substitute
1 lb. Chicken thighs, boneless and skinless
3.5 oz brown or white beech mushroom, optional
1 tsp arrowroot starch
1.5 tbsp avocado oil
2-2.5 tsp grated ginger
1 tsp coarse sea salt, plus more to taste
1 cup chicken or vegetable stock
1 to 1.5 tbsp yuzu juice, see notes for substitute
1.5 tbsp coconut aminos
1-2 bulbs scallions, chopped

Instructions: 
Slice off both ends of the daikon radish. Rinse and scrub under tap water. Pat dry and use a peeler to peel off the outer skin. Dice it to cube shape, about 1 to 1 ½ -inch cubes.

Dice the chicken to 1 ½ -inch bite sizes. Slice off the bottom end of the mushrooms and break them to pieces, if using. In a small bowl, make a slurry with arrowroot starch and 1 tbsp water.


Preheat a large stir-fry pan or Dutch oven over medium heat until it feels warm when placing your palm near the surface, about 2-3 inches away. Add the oil, chicken, ginger, and 1 tsp salt. Saute over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes.
Add stock, daikon radish, and mushrooms. Make sure the radish cubes are in contact with the liquid. Cover with a lid and bring it to boil, about 3-4 minutes.

Then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the daikon turns soft and can easily be poked through with a fork or chopstick. The color will turn from pale to translucent. Stir the pot periodically to ensure even cooking.

Season with yuzu juice and coconut aminos. Stir the slurry one more time before adding it to the pot. Gently toss for 30 seconds to thicken the sauce. Off heat, taste and add more salt, if desired.
Season with coconut aminos and yuzu sauce

Garnish with scallions. Serve warm.

1 jalapeño or serrano pepper, diced**
½ teaspoon ground cumin
1 ½ teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
½ teaspoon chipotle chile flakes or red pepper flakes***
1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
Freshly cracked black pepper
1 pound (454g) fresh tomatoes or 1 (14-ounce/400g) can of diced tomatoes
Finishing
A glug of extra virgin olive oil****
A squeeze or two of lime juice
1 cup (16g) fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped


Instructions
Don’t drain the beans!

Prep the fresh tomatoes, if using. Wash, and then add to a food processor and pulse until pureed. Or grate the tomatoes using the wide holes of a box grater.

Make the sofrito. Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat with 1 ½ tablespoons of oil. Once hot, add the onion with a pinch of salt and cook until the onion has softened and is golden but not browned, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, jalapeño, cumin, oregano, and chipotle flakes (if using) and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add the diced tomatoes. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a rapid simmer and cook until the tomatoes break down and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with the kosher salt and several cracks of black pepper.

Pour the black beans with their liquid into the sofrito. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 15 minutes until thickened and saucy. If it gets too thick, add a splash of vegetable broth if you have it, or water.

Stir in a glug of extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of lime juice, and cilantro. Taste, and add salt/pepper or more lime juice to taste.

Vietnamese-Style Sauteed Artichokes
Ingredients:
Juice of 1 lemon
6 small artichokes
2 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon fish sauce
2 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, plus 1 teaspoon lemon zest, or more to taste
3 tablespoons sunflower or other neutral oil
1 to 2 birdâ€™s eye chilies, minced, to taste
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 large spring onions, cut into quarters
3 tablespoons minced fresh dill

Instructions:
Squeeze the juice of one lemon into a bowl, and add about 1 cup water. Mix to combine.
Remove the leaves from the artichokes, cut lengthwise into quarters, and remove the choke, if necessary. Immediately put into the bowl of lemon juice-water, tossing to coat, to keep them from turning brown.
Peel and finely mince the garlic. Mix it with the fish sauce, 2 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, and lemon zest. Set aside.
Drain artichokes. Add sunflower oil to a saute pan over high heat, and saute artichokes for 6 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Add pepper, chiles, and spring onions 1 minute before the end of cooking, then drain off any excess oil, if necessary. Deglaze pan with garlic-fish sauce-lemon juice mixture. Garnish with dill, and serve.

Charred brussels sprouts with grapefruit and yuba
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

Instructions:
350g brussels sprouts, bases trimmed, halved
1/2 tsp salt
40g dried tofu sticks
Oil, as needed for deep-frying
3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise
3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
3/4 tsp sugar
45g Japanese pickled ginger, chopped
1 1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 large grapefruit
A handful of nori strips

For the brussels sprouts, preheat the oven to 445Â°F/230Â°C. Meanwhile, in an ovenproof pan, preferably made of cast-iron, toss together 2 tbsp oil, 350g brussels sprouts (bases trimmed, halved) and 1/2 tsp salt.

Place the brussels sprouts cut side down in the pan and set the pan on high heat for a few minutes, or until the cut sides of the brussels sprouts turn light golden. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the brussels sprouts are tender and charred.

For the tofu sticks, on high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, steam 40g dried tofu sticks.

Once the tofu sticks have softened up nicely, remove them from the steamer and snip them into 2-inch/5cm lengths with a pair of scissors.

To a sauce pan set on high heat, add oil (as needed for deep-frying). When the oil heats up to 300Â°F/150Â°C, add the tofu sticks. Cook for about a minute, turning occasionally until they puff and blister. They should hardly develop any colour. If the oil is too hot, the tofu sticks will brown too quickly and blisters will not form. Remove the fried tofu from the pan and transfer them to a paper towel-lined dish to drain.

For the dressing, in a small bowl, mix together 3 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaise, 3/4 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce, 3/4 tsp sugar, 45g Japanese pickled ginger (chopped) and 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil.

To serve, with a knife, remove the skin and pith of 1 large grapefruit. Peel and cut the grapefruit into segments, then cut each segment into thirds crosswise. Place the grapefruit in a serving bowl or platter and toss with the brussels sprouts and tofu sticks.

Drizzle the dressing over everything and scatter over a handful of nori strips.

Cabbage and glass noodles
Ingredients:
1 package mung bean vermicelli
(50g/1.75oz)
1 pound green cabbage (preferably Taiwanese cabbage; about 1/2 of a small to medium cabbage)
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (plus 1 teaspoon)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3-5 dried red chilis (break them open if you want more heat)
2 cloves garlic (chopped)
1 scallion (chopped)
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Instructions:
Soak the mung bean vermicelli noodles for about 10 minutes until soft. Cut the bundle in half to shorten the noodle lengths, and set them aside (still in the soaking water). Prep the cabbage by slicing it into 1/2-inch thick strips.
Beat the eggs along with the salt, sesame oil and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil, and the eggs quickly after. Scramble them for 20-30 seconds, until theyâ€™re just almost done (they can still be a bit runny). Take the eggs out of the wok and set aside.
Heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add the chili, garlic, and scallion. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to turn brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.

Cabbage and glass noodles
Ingredients:
1 package mung bean vermicelli
(50g/1.75oz)
1 pound green cabbage (preferably Taiwanese cabbage; about 1/2 of a small to medium cabbage)
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine (plus 1 teaspoon)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3-5 dried red chilis (break them open if you want more heat)
2 cloves garlic (chopped)
1 scallion (chopped)
1 teaspoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Instructions:
Soak the mung bean vermicelli noodles for about 10 minutes until soft. Cut the bundle in half to shorten the noodle lengths, and set them aside (still in the soaking water). Prep the cabbage by slicing it into 1/2-inch thick strips.
Beat the eggs along with the salt, sesame oil and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil, and the eggs quickly after. Scramble them for 20-30 seconds, until theyâ€™re just almost done (they can still be a bit runny). Take the eggs out of the wok and set aside.
Heat the 2 remaining tablespoons of oil in the wok over medium-high heat. Add the chili, garlic, and scallion. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Before the peppers and garlic start to turn brown, add the cabbage, and increase the heat to high. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted.
Pull the noodles out of the soaking water, and add them to the cabbage. Then add the cooked egg and the 1 remaining tablespoon of shaoxing wine. Stir-fry, then add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Stir everything together and continue to stir-fry for another 2 minutes or so, until the noodles are tender (add a splash of water if the noodles look dry). Plate and serve!
